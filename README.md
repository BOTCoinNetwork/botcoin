consensus](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble).

It underpins the [MONET Hub](https://monet.network/faq.html), which an
important port of the [MONET project](https://monet.network/about.html),
but is licensed under the [MIT
license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and available for
