# Monetd

Monetd is the daemon component of the **Monet Toolchain**; a distributed
smart-contract platform based on 
[EVM-Lite](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/evm-lite) and
[Babble](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble).

The **Monet Toolchain** underpins the
[MONET Hub](https://monet.network/faq.html), but it is also available for use in 
other projects. You can read more about MONET in the 
[whitepaper](http://bit.ly/monet-whitepaper).

This repository contains the code for `monetd` and `giverny`:

- `monetd` is the server process that validators are expected to run.
- `giverny` is the CLI for advanced testnet creation and management.
