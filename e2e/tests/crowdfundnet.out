EXPLANATION:
Each node controls one account which allows it to send and receive Ether. 
The private keys reside locally and directly on the evm-lite nodes. In a 
production setting, access to the nodes would be restricted to the people  
allowed to sign messages with the private key. We also keep a local copy 
of all the private keys to demonstrate client-side signing.[0m

EXPLANATION:
We created an EVM transaction to send 500 tokens from Amelia to Becky. The 
transaction was signed localy with Amelia's private key and sent through Amelia's node. 
The client-facing service running in EVM-Lite relayed the transaction to Babble 
for consensus ordering. Babble gossiped the raw transaction to the other Babble 
nodes which ran it through the consensus algorithm before committing it back to 
EVM-Lite as part of Block. So each node received and processed the transaction. 
They each applied the same changes to their local copy of the ledger.

[36m
EXPLANATION:
Here we compiled and deployed the CrowdFunding SmartContract. 
The contract was written in the high-level Solidity language which compiles 
down to EVM bytecode. To deploy the SmartContract we created an EVM transaction 
with a 'data' field containing the bytecode. After going through consensus, the 
transaction is applied on every node, so every participant will run a copy of 
the same code with the same data.[0m

  "amount": "499"
}
[36m
EXPLANATION:
We created an EVM transaction to call the 'contribute' method of the SmartContract. 
The 'value' field of the transaction is the amount that the caller is actually 
going to contribute. The operation would fail if the account did not have enough Ether. 
As an exercise you can check that the transaction was run through every Babble 
node and that Becky's balance has changed.[0m
