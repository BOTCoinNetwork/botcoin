The Monet Toolchain
===================

The Monet Toolchain provides software to run and interact with a distributed
smart-contract platform based on `EVM-Lite
<https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/evm-lite>`__ and `Babble consensus
<https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble>`__.

It underpins the `MONET Hub <https://monet.network/faq.html>`__, which is an
important part of the `MONET project <https://monet.network/about.html>`__, but
is licensed under the `MIT license
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`__ and available for use in other
projects. You can read more about MONET in the `whitepaper
<http://bit.ly/monet-whitepaper>`__.
