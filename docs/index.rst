The BOTCoin
===================

BOTCoin uses peer-to-peer network system technology at the bottom layer, allowing intelligent robots to become autonomous nodes in the decentralized network. It also integrates BVM to implement hardware-level smart contract programming, allowing the robot's own data and programs to be executed safely and reliably. Based on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, It is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) .

The BOTCoin Network based on `BVM
<https://github.com/BOTCoinNetwork/BVM>`__ and `Babble consensus
<https://github.com/BOTCoinNetwork/babble>`__.

but is licensed under the `MIT license
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`__ and available for use in other
projects. You can read more about BOTCoin in the `Whitepaper
<https://botcoin.network/BOTCoin_en.pdf>`__ and `BOTCoin Hub
<https://botcoin.network>`__.
