Why BOTCoin?
------------

The BOTCoin implements hardware-level programming smart contracts, which are bound to BOT hardware, to achieve direct interaction between the crypto world and the real world without the need for an intermediary. It satisfies the collaboration between multiple BOTs and crypto. It is the first time that the crypto world directly controls the real world without the need for an intermediary.
